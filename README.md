# Tensorflow Learning
Something about tensorflow calssical codes.

One part is some classical codes from the official models:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models

I made some little changes to make the codes easier to read, such as combining two scripts into one single script. So it is more convenient to copy and paste, instead of running commands.
